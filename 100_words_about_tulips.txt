Tulips are vibrant, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, known for their bold colors and elegant simplicity. Native to Central Asia, they became especially popular in the Netherlands, where they sparked “Tulip Mania” in the 17th century. Today, the Netherlands remains a major producer of tulip bulbs. Tulips come in a wide range of colors, each carrying its own symbolism—red for love, yellow for cheerfulness, and white for purity. They thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, making them a favorite in gardens and floral arrangements. Tulips symbolize renewal and are a cheerful sign that spring has arrived.
